# SOP Guide Studio ¬∑ Storyboard



## üèá Doing

-  Delete Starter
- Add, delete, duplicate and delete should be well functioning
- show actual values insted of variables on view guide
- we must have start point in our graph, wether it's an indicator or a step
-  import single starter to this current starter
-  make the user to choose the start of the starter step (if so we need to update the ensureMandatory function to say if it has already startId, then don't update it)
-  highlight the add button after clicking on it, on click again it should be cancelled
-  for multi select it should have onle one next
-  group right label to have matching fields together
-  mandate starter label while editing
-  make selected or active starter and active step on the url instead of variable to be able to share it
